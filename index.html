                    Hello and welcome to my About Me page! My name is Cole Kasabian, and I am an aspiring software developer. I am
                    currently studying at the University of Arizona, where I will be graduating by the end of this year.
                </p>
                <p class="resume">
                    Ever since I was a child, I have had a fascination with technology and how it works. As I grew older, I became more
                    and more interested in software development, and I decided to pursue a career in this field. I am passionate about
                    creating innovative solutions to complex problems, and I believe that software development is the perfect way to do
                    this.
                </p>
                <p class="resume">
                    Throughout my time at the University of Arizona, I have had the opportunity to participate in an intensive software
                    development bootcamp through the university's online program. This program has allowed me to gain valuable experience
                    working on a number of real-world projects and has helped me develop a deeper understanding of software engineering
                    principles.
                </p>
                <p class="resume">    
                    During the bootcamp, I had the chance to work on projects in a variety of different programming languages and
                    frameworks, including JavaScript, React, and Node.js. I also had the opportunity to collaborate with other aspiring
                    software developers and industry professionals, which helped me gain valuable insights into the field.
                </p>
                <p class="resume">    
                    Aside from my studies, I enjoy staying active by playing sports like basketball, as well as working out. I also love spending
                    time outdoors and exploring new places. Whether I am hiking in the mountains or relaxing on the beach, I am always
                    up for an adventure.
